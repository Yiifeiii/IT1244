#IT1244 Project Team32

The code folder consists of the following: 
Cancer vs Healthy Code
Early Stage vs Healthy Code
Neural Network Code
All code was done on Google Colab. Please open the files in numerical order.

Before running any of the code, do upload the Train.csv and Test.csv files into Google Colab. 
Please run the code in each file in chronological order. (Do not run the next code if the previous has not been run.)
